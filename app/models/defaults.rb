      "Turing School of Software & Design, Diversity Scholarship Announcement
      Turing stands for the inclusion and equality of all people, regardless of race,
      gender, sexual orientation, age, zip code, background, or life experience. When we look
      at the tech industry overall, though, we see significant biases and a lot of missing faces.
      So many amazing people who could make monumental contributions to software
      development have not yet entered the field. This needs to change.
      People build software to solve problems, but we tend to only solve problems
      when we know they exist. Until the experiences of all software developers begin to
      mirror the experiences of all software users, real problems will remain unsolved and real
      needs will remain unmet. If you don’t see yourself as fitting some “typical software
      developer mold”, then you are exactly who we need. We want you to study at Turing
      precisely because you break the mold. Your differences are valuable.
      At Turing School, we want to do what we can to address whatever is holding you
      back; whether it’s a lack of role models, an unwelcoming and exclusive culture in the
      industry, unhelpful policies, limited exposure to technology, or simply not realizing what
      a great fit you might be. We know there are some things we can’t change, but we are
      committed to accomplishing what we can. Let’s start with access to an unsurpassed
      education and build a community together. We’ll help you form a support network,
      connect you with mentors, and stand with you as you launch and grow your career.
      One thing we can do right now is help with the cost. In July 2015, we launched
      our first ever scholarship program for women. Today, we’ve expanded the scholarship
      program to include all underrepresented groups. We have two scholarships available at
      $4,000/each for every cohort for each program. If you belong to any group that is
      underrepresented in technology and you have been accepted to study at Turing, we
      invite you to apply.
      Eligibility and Deadlines for November Scholarships:
      Scholarship applicants must be accepted into the Turing School of Software & Design
      for the 1708 cohort, which begins August 14, 2017 and meet the following qualifications:
      1. Identify as a member of at least one group that is underrepresented in
      technology (e.g. Black, Latino/a, Native American, Pacific Islander, Woman,
      LGBTQ, or veteran)
      2. Be accepted into the school and commit to the August cohort, which starts on
      August 14, 2017.
      3. Upon acceptance, complete a brief (approximately 1000 words) scholarship
      essay (below). Our scholarship panel will award scholarships based on your
      essay response (passion, determination, and financial need). Scholarship
      essays are due by Sunday, July 9th, midnight and emailed to Joanne Liu
      (joanne@turing.io)​.
      How much are the Scholarships Worth?
      Scholarships will be awarded in the form of tuition waivers of $4,000 to be applied to
      your first day payment. Combined with Turing’s deferment options, scholarships will
      allow recipients to start at Turing for as little as $1,000.
      Scholarship Program Essay (due July 9, 2017):
      The purpose of this essay is to allow the scholarship panel to learn more about you, to
      better understand your passion and determination to become a programmer, and to
      understand your relative financial need.
      1. In 200-300 words, please tell us the story of how you became interested in a
      career in software development.
      2. In 200-300 words, please share something you would be passionate about
      contributing to the world in the next five years.
      3. In 200-300 words, please share a challenge/situation you have experienced that

      and how you overcame that challenge or handled that situation.
      4. In 200-300 words, please describe your financial barriers and how participation in
      this scholarship program could impact your ability to pursue education at Turing
      and a career in software development.

      paragraph form for a total of four paragraphs.
